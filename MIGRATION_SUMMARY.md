# Database Migration Summary

## âœ… Migration Completed Successfully

### Old Database (No longer in use)
- **Name:** `PDSAdhesive`
- **Status:** Still exists but not used by application
- **Collections:**
  - AEDatabase (old product collection)
  - Various other collections from testing

### New Database (Active)
- **Name:** `PDSAdhesiveSearch`
- **Status:** Active and configured in application
- **Collections:**
  - `AESearchDatabase` - Product catalog (migrated)
  - `AdhesivePDSDocumentMaster` - Technical documents
  - `PDSAdhesiveSearchCollection` - Search history
  - `CustomerPreferences` - User preferences
  - `KnowledgeBase` - Knowledge entities
  - Time-series collections for metrics

## Configuration Updates

All configuration files have been updated to use the new database:

1. **Environment Files:**
   - `.env` - Updated with new database name
   - `.env.example` - Template updated

2. **Source Code:**
   - `src/config/index.js` - Default database name updated
   - All scripts updated to use new database

3. **Connection String:**
   ```
   mongodb://[username]:[password]@[cluster]/PDSAdhesiveSearch?[options]
   ```

## Important Notes

- The old `PDSAdhesive` database cannot be dropped due to permission restrictions
- The application is fully functional with the new `PDSAdhesiveSearch` database
- All data has been successfully migrated to the new database
- Daily sync scripts and data loaders are configured for the new database

## Next Steps

1. **Manual Cleanup (Optional):**
   - Contact database administrator to drop the old `PDSAdhesive` database
   - This is not critical as the application no longer uses it

2. **Continue Using New Database:**
   - All operations should use `PDSAdhesiveSearch`
   - Data loading scripts are configured correctly
   - Daily sync will work with new database

## Verification

To verify the migration:
```bash
# Check data in new database
node check-mongodb-data.js

# Load sample data
node scripts/data-loader.js

# Start application
npm start
```

The application is fully operational with the new database structure!
